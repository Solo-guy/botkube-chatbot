# Botkube AI Capabilities

## Overview

Botkube's AI system is designed to handle both Kubernetes-specific queries and general everyday questions effectively. The system uses different processing pipelines optimized for each type of query to provide the most accurate and helpful responses.

## Kubernetes Query Handling

For Kubernetes-related queries, Botkube leverages specialized knowledge about:

- Kubernetes resources (pods, deployments, services, etc.)
- Best practices for Kubernetes management
- Common troubleshooting workflows
- Resource monitoring and optimization

### Sample Kubernetes Queries

- "How do I check pod logs in Kubernetes?"
- "What's the command to scale a deployment?"
- "How can I troubleshoot a pod in CrashLoopBackOff state?"
- "Show me how to set up an ingress controller"

### Workflow Suggestions

For Kubernetes queries, Botkube will automatically suggest relevant workflows - sequences of commands that can be executed to accomplish tasks. These workflows can be:

- Executed step-by-step
- Saved for future use
- Customized to fit your specific environment

## General Knowledge Queries

Botkube's AI can also answer general questions on a wide range of topics. The system will:

- Provide factual information where possible
- Offer contextually relevant suggestions
- Generate helpful workflows even for non-Kubernetes topics

### Sample General Queries

- "What is the capital of France?"
- "How does DNS work?"
- "Explain cloud computing concepts"
- "What are microservices?"

## AI Configuration

You can configure the AI behavior through the following options:

### Model Selection

Botkube supports multiple AI models that can be selected based on your preference:

- Grok (default)
- OpenAI
- Claude
- Gemini

Select your preferred model from the dropdown menu in the chat interface.

### Response Format

The AI responses include:

- Clear, readable text with appropriate formatting
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting for commands and scripts
- Copy functionality for easy use of provided code
- Workflow suggestions for actionable next steps

## Optimizations

The system includes the following optimizations for best performance:

1. **Specialized Kubernetes Detection**: Automatically detects and routes Kubernetes queries to specialized processing
2. **Custom Workflow Generation**: Creates contextually relevant workflows for both Kubernetes and general topics
3. **Cross-Platform Command Support**: Ensures commands work across different operating systems
4. **Fallback Handling**: Provides useful responses even when offline or when facing connectivity issues

## Best Practices

- Be specific in your questions for more accurate responses
- Use natural language rather than trying to use specific AI-friendly formats
- For Kubernetes queries, mentioning the specific resource type (pod, deployment, etc.) will help get more precise answers
- Save frequently used workflows for quick access
